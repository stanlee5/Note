Computer
architectures: ISA. 프로그래머가 볼 수 있다(instruction set, data representation, I/O 메커니즘, 메모리 어드레싱)
organization: physical details. 하드웨어 implementation of an instruction, depth of pipeline, data paths, 
hardware

ISA가 좋으려면?: 프로그래머 convenience(더 많은 operations), interpreting the instrunctions cost, speed of the com. , code size
ISA의 dimensions

ISA vs. ABI(application binary interface)

Measure com. performance: reponse시간, throughput
ㄴAnalytical approaches
 - cpu performance: cpu time spent
 - instruction per.: CPI(clocks per instruction), MIPS(instruction cnt/execution time*10^6)
ㄴBenchmarking

clock period & rate -> 곱하면 1
cpu execution time: cpu clock cycles(or frequencey) * clock cycle time(or period)
cpu clock cycles: instruction number for a program * average clock cycles per instruction n(CPI)

convenctional wisdom in Com. arch.
- Power wall (power 비쌈, transistors 쌈)
- ILP wall
- Memory wll (Dram 메모리 200clock cycles, multiply 4 clocks)
- the Brick Wall. cpu속도향상 느려짐
